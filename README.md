# DevOps-First-Scripts-Exercise

## Welcome to the DevOps First Class Scripting Exercise!

#### In this exercise we will create our very first scripts, one in Bash and one in Python!
 You might be wondering what's a script, what is Bash, what is Python? And that is quite alright, 
 we will dive into the details of these things as we progress through the course. But for now, here is a high level explanation:
 - a script is a way to automate an action(s) or process(es) that is usually done manually, saving DevOps engineers lots of time
 - Bash is a command line language, most commonly seen in Linux/Unix Operating Systems (OS), used to interact with the OS.
 - Python is a common programming language, used to create lightwieght scripts to full-fledge applications and programs.
 
 #### Let's Get Started!
 
 1. Navigate to the [JSLinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/) webpage in your browser of choice (Chrome is highly recommended).
 You should then see a screen that looks like this:

2. Notice the red outline in the screenshot, we want to select that Linux OS. To do that click on `Click Here`
You should now see a screen that looks like this:

This is a Linux OS terminal, which is just a command line way of interacting with your OS. All OS today have a command line way of interaction.
In this terminal we can type commands and do things (create/move/update/delete files and folders, launch applications, user administration, etc.).
For this exercise, we will create two scripts that display "Hello World, my name is <Insert Your Name Here>."
